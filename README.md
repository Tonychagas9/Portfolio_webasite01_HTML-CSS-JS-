# Portfolio_webasite01_HTML-CSS-JS-

Hi There! 

The aim of this project was to create a portfolio website that was as simple, cool, and responsive as possible.

In this same project, you will be able to see the use of semantic HTML and code organization through divisions, IDs, and classes.

In the case of CSS in this project, you can see the use of @keyframes to create animations and @mediaqueries to make it responsive in other resolutions,

And last but not least we have JS which in this project was used to give life to two functions that were both "toggle" for the Hamburger Menu and for the Switch Background Color button.

Enjoy
